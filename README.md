## 📖 About This Project

**SOC-Nemotron-CLI-Windows** is the Windows edition of my [SOC-Nemotron-CLI](https://github.com/amitambekar510) project — a hands-on operational guide and prompt library for **Security Operations Center (SOC) Analysts, Threat Hunters, Detection Engineers, and Incident Responders** to leverage **NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Ultra (550B)** — a free, hosted, agentic-reasoning LLM — directly from a Windows terminal via **OpenCode CLI**.

This repository is part of my ongoing self-study into **emerging AI tooling in the cybersecurity space**, adapted for Windows-based SOC analyst workstations — no local GPU required.

> 📚 Compiled for study/reference purposes, adapting the original macOS-tested guide for Windows.

---

## 🚀 Why This Stack

- **Terminal-native** — stays inside the analyst's existing workflow (PowerShell / Windows Terminal) instead of switching to a browser chat window mid-investigation.
- **Agentic, not just chat** — OpenCode can read files, run scripts, iterate on errors, and write output artifacts autonomously (`--loop` mode).
- **1M-token context** — large enough to ingest full log files, PCAP metadata dumps, or multi-file evidence sets in a single pass.
- **No local GPU required** — Nemotron 3 Ultra runs on NVIDIA's hosted endpoint, so a standard Windows analyst laptop is enough.
- **Scriptable & pipeline-friendly** — CLI-based, so it can be chained into PowerShell scripts, scheduled tasks, or existing SOC automation.

## 💻 Platform Support

> ### ⚠️ Original project tested on macOS only — this Windows edition is new and community-testing
> The base workflow (OpenCode + NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Ultra) was originally documented and verified on **macOS**. This Windows edition adapts the same setup and prompt library for native Windows / PowerShell — commands below are based on OpenCode's official documentation and standard Windows/Node.js conventions, but **full end-to-end testing on native Windows is still in progress.**
>
> Platform differences here are mostly cosmetic (PATH handling, shell syntax) rather than functional — the underlying CLI and API behavior is identical across platforms. If you test this on Windows and hit something that needs fixing, I'd genuinely appreciate you reaching out — see [Author](#-author) below.

| Platform | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🍎 macOS | ✅ Tested & Documented ([original repo](https://github.com/amitambekar510)) |
| 🪟 **Windows** | 🧪 **This repo — community-testing, feedback welcome** |
| 🐧 Linux | 🔜 Companion repo — see [Roadmap](#-roadmap) |

## ⚡ Setup & Authentication *(Windows)*

### 0. Get Your NVIDIA API Key

1. Open the [NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Ultra model page](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b) and sign in / create a free NVIDIA account.
2. Click **Generate API Key**.
3. Copy the key — it looks like `nvapi-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.

> ⚠️ Never share your API key publicly or commit it to source control.

### 1. Install Prerequisites

OpenCode CLI requires **Node.js**. If you don't already have it:

1. Download and install [Node.js LTS for Windows](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Verify in **PowerShell**:

```powershell
node -v
npm -v
```

### 2. Install OpenCode CLI

Open **PowerShell** (or Windows Terminal) and run:

```powershell
npm install -g opencode-ai
```

> This is the recommended path on native Windows. The Unix-style `curl | bash` installer used on macOS/Linux does not apply directly to PowerShell — if you prefer that installer, use **WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and follow the [Linux edition of this guide](#) instead.

See the [official OpenCode documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs/) for details.

### 3. Confirm OpenCode Is on PATH

`npm install -g` normally adds OpenCode to your PATH automatically. If PowerShell doesn't recognize the command after installing:

```powershell
# Find where npm installs global packages
npm config get prefix

# Add that path to your User PATH via System Properties > Environment Variables,
# or temporarily for the current session:
$env:Path += ";$(npm config get prefix)"
```

Restart PowerShell after updating environment variables permanently.

### 4. Launch OpenCode and Connect to NVIDIA NIM

```powershell
# Navigate to your investigation / log directory
cd C:\soc-investigations

# Launch OpenCode TUI
opencode

# Authenticate and select Nemotron 3 Ultra
/connect NVIDIA nvapi-YOUR_NVIDIA_API_KEY
/models  # Select: nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b
```

### 5. Provider Configuration

Add the following to your OpenCode config file (typically `%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\opencode.json` — confirm exact path via `opencode --help` on your installed version):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "nvidia": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "NVIDIA NIM",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1",
        "apiKey": "nvapi-YOUR_NVIDIA_API_KEY"
      },
      "models": {
        "nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b": {
          "name": "Nemotron 3 Ultra (550B)",
          "limit": {
            "context": 1000000,
            "output": 16384
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Replace `nvapi-YOUR_NVIDIA_API_KEY` with your actual NVIDIA NIM API key. Never commit real keys to source control — use environment variables or a secrets manager instead.

## ✅ Verify Your Installation

```powershell
# Confirm OpenCode is installed and on PATH
opencode --version

# Confirm the NVIDIA provider is connected and the model is selected
opencode
/models   # nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b should show as active

# Run a quick smoke-test prompt
opencode "Reply with a one-line confirmation that Nemotron 3 Ultra is connected and ready."
```

If the model responds, your setup is complete and you're ready to move on to the SOC use cases below.

---

## 🧰 Example Prompts by Use Case

### IOC Extraction & Firewall Blocklist Generation

```powershell
opencode "Read threat_feed.txt, extract all IPv4 addresses and SHA256 hashes, defang IPs (e.g., 192.168.1[.]1), and structure into firewall_blocklist.json."
```

### Sigma Detection Rule Authoring

```powershell
opencode "Analyze malicious_ps_execution.log and build a valid Sigma detection rule targeting obfuscated PowerShell commands with MITRE ATT&CK mapping."
```

### Autonomous Memory Forensics Triage (Loop Mode)

```powershell
opencode --loop "Write a Python script to parse memory dump metadata using Volatility3, run it against sample.raw, fix any syntax or execution errors, and generate a markdown triage report."
```

---

## 🖥️ Sample Output (Illustrative)

To show the *shape* of what Nemotron 3 Ultra returns, here's an illustrative (redacted/simplified) example for the **Sigma Detection Rule Authoring** prompt above:

```yaml
title: Obfuscated PowerShell Execution Detected
id: 3f1a2b4c-illustrative-example
status: experimental
description: Detects encoded/obfuscated PowerShell command-line patterns commonly used to evade logging.
logsource:
  category: process_creation
  product: windows
detection:
  selection:
    Image|endswith: '\powershell.exe'
    CommandLine|contains:
      - '-enc'
      - '-EncodedCommand'
      - 'IEX('
      - 'FromBase64String'
  condition: selection
level: high
tags:
  - attack.execution
  - attack.t1059.001
```

> ⚠️ This is a simplified, illustrative example to show output format — not a production-validated rule. Always run generated Sigma/YARA rules and firewall entries through analyst review before deployment.

## 💰 Rate Limits & Cost Notes

- NVIDIA's hosted endpoint for Nemotron 3 Ultra is currently offered under a **free trial/API tier** — exact request-per-minute and token quotas are set by NVIDIA and **subject to change without notice**.
- Check current limits on your [NVIDIA build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b) account dashboard before relying on it for time-sensitive IR work.
- For high-volume or production SOC use, plan for the possibility of moving to a paid tier or self-hosted inference in the future.

## 🧩 Troubleshooting *(Windows)*

| Issue | Technical Cause | Operational Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `'opencode' is not recognized...` | npm global bin folder not in PATH | Run `npm config get prefix`, add that folder to your User PATH via Environment Variables, then restart PowerShell. |
| `npm install -g` fails with permission errors | PowerShell not run with sufficient rights, or npm global prefix pointing to a protected folder | Run PowerShell **as Administrator**, or reconfigure npm's global prefix to a user-writable folder (`npm config set prefix "%APPDATA%\npm"`). |
| Execution Policy blocks scripts | Windows PowerShell script execution restricted by default | Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` (review the security implications before changing this). |
| Execution Timeout on PCAPs | Local security tool binaries (`tshark`, `yara`, `volatility3`) missing or not on PATH | Install these tools for Windows and ensure they're in your system PATH. |

---

## 🗑️ Uninstall / Disconnect

**Remove OpenCode CLI:**

```powershell
npm uninstall -g opencode-ai
```

Then remove any PATH entry you added manually via Environment Variables.

**Revoke your NVIDIA API key:**

1. Go to your [NVIDIA build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b) account.
2. Navigate to API Keys and delete/revoke the key used for this project.

---

## ⚠️ Security & Operational Guidelines

1. **Redact Sensitive Data** — Always scrub production credentials, API secrets, and sensitive PII from logs before passing them to AI prompts.
2. **Isolate Environments** — Run autonomous loops (`--loop`) inside isolated staging VMs or containers when interacting with suspicious files.
3. **Analyst Verification** — Always manually inspect generated firewall rules and SIEM correlation queries prior to pushing to production environments.
